<h3 align="center">&ldquo;The person who never made a mistake never made anything.&rdquo;</h3>
<p align="center">I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Southern California working on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. I worked as a Systems Engineer at TCS for more than one and a half years and also have a keen interest in IoT and Web Development. I have worked on various Full Stack Web Development and have made some IoT Based Automation systems. I am extremely interested about Virology, so if you are one of them, I will buy you a Coffee. Else if you loved my work, you may buy me one!</p>
